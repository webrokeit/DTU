\section*{Progress}
\subsection*{Things that are going well}
We have managed to finish implementing the game. It recognizes when the user squats or jumps.

\subsection*{Things that are not going so well}
We found out that the old game was not doable the way we wanted to do it. Therefore we have changed the game - see next section.

\subsection*{Any changes in the project}
The game has been changed to a Memory Game of training exercises. Round 1 has 1 exercise the user has to remember and then perform. The numbers of exercises increase with the number of rounds. Round 1 would for example be jump and then round 2 would be jump, squat and so forth. So each round it only adds one more exercise to be performed. The order of exercises will stay the same throughout the game.

\subsection*{Brief summary of what has been done since last report}
The old game was discarded and the new game has been implemented. It is ready for testing by our chosen test groups.
