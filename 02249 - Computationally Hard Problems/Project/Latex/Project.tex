\textbf{Problem:} \textsc{[MirrorFriendlyMinimumSpanningTree (MFMST)]}\\
\textbf{Input:} An undirected, connected weighted graph $G = (V,E,w)$, where $V = \{1,\dots,n\}$, $E = \{e_1,\dots,e_m\}$ and $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_0$, and a number $B \in \mathbb{N}$.\\
\textbf{Output:} YES if there is a spanning tree $T \subseteq E$ for $G$ such that
$$max \left\{\nsum\limits_{e_i \in T} w(e_i), \nsum\limits_{e_i \in T} w(e_{m+1-i})\right\} \leq B$$
and NO otherwise.\\

\subsection*{a) Description of the problem in colloquial terms}
A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph within an undirected, connected weighted graph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together with a weight less or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The main difference between a minimum spanning tree and a mirror friendly minimum spanning tree is the inequality described above. In a mirror friendly minimum spanning tree the inequality must be satisfied. It should be possible to mirror the spanning tree in such a way that the maximum of the spanning tree and the mirrored spanning tree is less than or equal to a fixed value, $B$. This also means that the mirror friendly minimum spanning tree may not be equal to the minimum spanning tree in the graph, i.e. it may have a larger weight than the minimum spanning tree.

\subsubsection*{Solve an example problem}
\textbf{Input:} $V = \{1,2,3\}$, $E = \{e_1 = \{1,2\},e_2 = \{2,3\},e_3 = \{1,3\}\}$, $w(e_i) = i$ for $i \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $B = 4$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l c c c }
\# & Spanning Tree & & Mirrored Spanning Tree\\
1. & $w(e_1) + w(e_2) = 3$ & & $w(e_{3+1-1)} + w(e_{3+1-2}) = w(e_3) + w(e_2) = 5$\\
2. & $w(e_3) + w(e_1) = 4$ & & $w(e_{3+1-3}) + w(e_{3+1-1}) = w(e_3) + w(e_1) = 4$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Shown above are the sum of the weights for two pairs of spanning trees. The first pair has a spanning tree with a weight of 3 and a mirrored spanning tree with a weight of 5. The maximum of these values would therefore be 5 which is more than $B$. Therefore the first pair does not satisfy the requirement to be a $MFMST$.
$$max\{3,5\} \leq B \rightarrow 5 \nleq 4$$
The second pair has a spanning tree with a weight of 4 and a mirrored spanning tree with a weight of 4. The maximum of these values would therefore be 4 which is the same as B. The pair therefore satisfies the requirement to be a $MFMST$.
$$max\{4,4\} \leq B \rightarrow 4 \leq 4$$
The algorithm would output YES.

\subsection*{b) Show that MFMST is in $NP$}
\subsubsection*{1. Design a deterministic algorithm $A$ which takes as input a problem instance $X$ and random sequence $R$}
\textbf{Specify what the random sequence $R$ consists of}\\
Let the string $R$ consist of bits: $R = r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n$.\\[0.25cm]
\textbf{Specify how $A$ interprets $R$ as a guess}\\
Consider the first $m$ bits. If the $i$-th bit is 1, mark the edge $e_i$.\\[0.25cm]
\textbf{Specify how $A$ verifies the guess}\\
If the marked edges create a mirror friendly minimum spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to $B$, answer YES, otherwise NO.
\subsubsection*{2. Show that the two conditions are met}
\textbf{If the answer to $X$ is YES, then there is a string $R^*$ with positive probability such that $A(X, R^*) = YES$}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Asssume that the answer is YES
\item[] Then there is a subset of the edges that creates a mirror friendly minimum spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to $B$.
\item[] Let $S \subseteq \{1,\dots,m\}$ be the set that describe the edges' index
\item[] Construct the bit string $R^* = r_1,r_2,\dots,r_m$ where $r_i = 1$ if and if only if $i \in S$
\item[] When $A$ receives $R^*$, it will select the edges in $S$, check that the weight of the edges are less than or equal to $B$ and answer YES.
\item[] Altogether there is a string of length at most $p(n)$ that will give YES. The probability of randomly creating it is positive.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{If the answer to $X$ is NO, then $A(X, R) = NO$ for all $R$}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Assume that the answer is NO
\item[] Then no set of the edges create a mirror friendly minimum spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to $B$.
\item[] If $R$ does not contain enough bits, the algorithm will correctly answer NO.
\item[] Otherwise the algorithm will mark some edges and compute their weight. This will be compared to $B$. But as no set of edges has a weight less than or equal to $B$, the answer is NO.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{3. Show that $A$ is $p$-bounded for some polynomial $p$}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] There are $m$ edges.
\item[] It is checked that the string $R$ consists of at least $m$ bits. Time: $O(m)$.
\item[] Every edge is marked or not marked. Time: $O(m)$.
\item[] The weights of the marked edges are added. Time: $O(m)$.
\item[] The computed total weight is compared to $B$ and the answer is returned. Time: $O(1)$.
\end{itemize}
Altogether the time is: $O(m)$.
\subsection*{c) Show that MFMST is $NP$-complete}
